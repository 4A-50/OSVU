# Contributing To OSVU
Thanks for having a look on how to contribute. This definitely not a solo project and any help I can get is more than appreciated.

If u have an idea of something that should be added, check the [roadmap](https://app.gitkraken.com/glo/board/XeTm5ecC6AAPsU5b "RoadMap") first just to make sure it’s not either already in development or planned.

# How To Contribute
## Testing
The best way to test OSVU is to just play it. Just download a copy of the files and play! Keep us in the loop is u find any bugs by submitting an issue (just check its not already one).

## Reporting Bugs
Obviously check that this bug isn’t already know and if it isn’t then good news, you get to submit a bug report!

### How To Submit A Good Bug Report:

Create an issue on the project's repository and provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help someone reproduce the problem:
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Provide a simplified project that reproduces the issue whenever possible.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you used the project. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. It's always better to get more information. You can include links to files or GitHub projects, code snippets and even print screens or animated GIFS. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
- Describe the behaviour you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behaviour.
- Explain which behaviour you expected to see instead and why.
 -  If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Also It Helps To Include details about your configuration and environment:
- Which version of the project are you using?
- What's the name and version of the OS you're using?
- Any other information that could be useful about your environment

## Submitting An Idea
Before submitting a new idea, please check the list of idea suggestions in the issue tracker and the roadmap as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When submitting an idea add as much detail as possible it’s a lot easier for someone to make it if they know 100% what u mean.
